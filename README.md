During this exercise the observations I made where that Charter Schools compared to District School had a higher Avg Math and Reading Scores- % Overall Passing 95% Charter & 73% District. A second observation
that was made is that School size also played a role in having higher math and reading scores compared to a larger school size. This shows that the teacher to student ratio does impact overall scores.
For instance Small/Medium schools had very similar Math & Reading Scores comapred to a larger school.
